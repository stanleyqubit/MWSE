The uiSkillTooltip event triggers when a new tooltip is displayed for a skill. The tooltip will be already be built.

Note that tooltips may have different width depending on which menu they were created in, between 230 and 432 pixels by default.
	

```lua
--- @param e uiSkillTooltipEventData
local function uiSkillTooltipCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.uiSkillTooltip, uiSkillTooltipCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data
