This event fires whenever a tes3dialogueInfo has been selected for a given tes3dialogue. This includes but is not limited to showing greetings, finding voice overs, and calculating service requirements.

```lua
--- @param e dialogueFilteredEventData
local function dialogueFilteredCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.dialogueFiltered, dialogueFilteredCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
