# dofile
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">dofile</div>

Reads, loads, and excutes a lua file at a given path. Similar to the `require` and `include` functions, `dofile` allows the use of periods as a path delimiter. Unlike `require`, a path relative to Morrowind.exe may be given.

```lua
dofile(path)
```

**Parameters**:

* `path` (string)
