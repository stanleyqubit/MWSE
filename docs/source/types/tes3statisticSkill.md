# tes3statisticSkill

A structure that holds statistical information relating to the current and base values of a skill statistic.

Morrowind statistics do not track buffs and debuffs separately. Instead, total buff or debuff values can be calculated with the [`tes3.getEffectMagnitude()`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/apis/tes3/#tes3geteffectmagnitude) function, using the appropriate buff or debuff magic effect for the statistic.

This type inherits the following: [tes3statistic](../../types/tes3statistic)
## Properties
